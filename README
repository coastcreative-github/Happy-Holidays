Happy Holidays Business Catalyst Source Tree
============================================

Description

  This is the Happy Holidays Business Catalyst tree.

  NB. Beware the root directory itself is included;
  the .git tree itself is in the actual root/.
  I don't know if this is a prudent
  convention. I set it up that way on my host a few days ago as it seemed like
  the simplest way to keep DW (or other ftp clients) from transferring the .git
  tree itself back and forth from the BC server.
  I'm going to rename it "bc-root"
